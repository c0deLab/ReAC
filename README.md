# Rethinking Automation in Construction (ReAC)

ReAC is a research group at Carnegie Mellon’s Computational Design Laboratory investigating ways of combining artificial intelligence and robotics to support architectural construction. We are interested in adaptive systems that enhance and interact with human expertise on site, and in articulating a vision for human-machine construction ecologies that does not aspire to full automation. Comprising faculty, graduate, and undergraduate students in the School of Architecture and Robotics Institute, the group is currently developing a software framework for robotically-assisted construction based on reinforcement learning methods, and investigating human-machine interaction challenges specific to building contexts.

### [(Current Work) Towards a Robotically Supported Collaborative Construction (RSCC)](page/rscc.md)

The ReAC RSCC project mobilizes recent advances in AI and robotics towards the concept of robotically supported cooperative construction. Instead of fully automated systems, it seeks to develop robots able to support human workers on construction sites through human-robot interactive, collaborative, assistive, and facilitative systems using reinforcement learning / AI as their key technical advantage. The project is a collaborative effort between faculty and students in the Computational Design Laboratory (School of Architecture) and the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.

* We conduct a qualitative / observational study to gain a deep understanding of specific building construction activities 
* We observe and document the specific activities, and engage with and learn from the construction personnel in order to reflectively inform the development of the robotic system
* We use reinforcement learning (RL), which is a special genre of machine learning (ML), for adaptive solutions of aforementioned questions.
In particular, we apply state of the art social navigation algorithms to enable robots safely navigating among humans.
* We conduct exploratory research on human-robot interaction, and revise the relationship through an interactive, integrated, and immersive angle.

### [Using Reinforcement Learning to Support Scalable Multi-Drone Construction in Dynamic Environments](page/drone.md)

Recent research in the field of architectural and construction robotics has explored robots’ potential to support construction tasks including, bricklaying, frame structure assembly, 3D printing, tensile structure weaving, nailing, spraying, and site data collection. However, a common limitation of these approaches is their lack of generalizability and scalability, as well as the assumption that drones work under highly controlled environments in isolation from human builders and environmental changes. In this paper we document progress towards an architectural framework for distributed robotically-assisted construction that takes into account the environmental and social dynamism of construction sites. We draw from state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques to propose a software framework allowing for a variable number of drones to dynamically execute pick and place and spraycoating tasks. Documenting the framework for robotically-assisted construction through simulations and a proof-of-concept outline, this paper contributes to current research in architectural and construction robotics, and advances a vision for semi-autonomous construction ecosystems interfacing humans and computational systems.
