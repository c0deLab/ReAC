# Towards a Robotically Supported Collaborative Construction (RSCC)

The ReAC RSCC project mobilizes recent advances in AI and robotics towards the concept of robotically supported cooperative construction. Instead of fully automated systems, it seeks to develop robots able to support human workers on construction sites through human-robot interactive, collaborative, assistive, and facilitative systems using reinforcement learning / AI as their key technical advantage. The project is a collaborative effort between faculty and students in the Computational Design Laboratory (School of Architecture) and the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University.

## Key Challenges
Construction sites vs. standardized structured settings (e.g. factories)
* Involve highly bespoke, dynamic, flexible, manual, and complex processes
* Unstructured and uncertain with improvised actions
* Dynamic and messy with various activities, obstacles, and people moving in one space 
  
## Key Questions
* In what ways can construction work and workers inform the design of a robotic system?
* How do we develop a robotic system that is responsive to the specificities of construction work / site? 
* How can robot safely navigate within a crowded human workspace?
* How can robot interact with human workers? Is there a way to include humans-in-the-loop for robot learning?
* What assistance does the robot provide?

## Our Approach
* We conduct a qualitative / observational study to gain a deep understanding of specific building construction activities 
* We observe and document the specific activities, and engage with and learn from the construction personnel in order to reflectively inform the development of the robotic system
* We use reinforcement learning (RL), which is a special genre of machine learning (ML), for adaptive solutions of aforementioned questions.
In particular, we apply state of the art social navigation algorithms to enable robots safely navigating among humans.
* We conduct exploratory research on human-robot interaction, and revise the relationship through an interactive, integrated, and immersive angle.
